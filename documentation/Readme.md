Documentation
================

SafeFrame API documentation can be generated using JSDoc. 
As of source version 1.1.1 the SafeFrame reference implementation
will not maintain JSDoc output in the source tree as it bloats the
code tree and has not been maintained in an up-to-date manner.

Additional information on SafeFrame may be found in the project wiki
or on http://safeframes.net
